                <p>As a way to teach the verse draw a large circle on the board with 2 smaller circles inside the large circle. On the center smaller circle talk to the students about what Jesus meant when He told them to be His witnesses in Jerusalem.</p>

                  <ol>
                    <li>Use a map (if available) to point out the area mentioned in the verse. (Jerusalem is where the apostles lived.)</li>
                    <li>Place the name of the city or town your church is located in the center circle.</li>
                    <li>Explain that Judea and Samaria were surrounding areas to Jerusalem.</li>
                    <li>In the second circle have a student write the name of the state they are in and some surrounding states.</li>
                    <li>To the ends of the earth would be outside the surrounding states to other countries around the world.</li>
                    <li>Have students write in the 3rd circles some names of countries.</li>

                  <p class="highlight-text">These 3 circles make me think of what happens when you throw a stone in a lake or pond. There is a ripple effect that happens because the rock hit the water. It's the same with the message of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>When you and I take that message to others there is a ripple effect that takes place. As you share with others and they believe in Jesus and they share with others, the circle keeps growing.</p>

                <p>This morning, we are beginning a new journey in our class. We are going to be traveling through the Book of Acts. As we take this trip together, we will witness some amazing things.</p>
                <p>As we study and learn together, we will learn how we can live powerful lives like the believers we will be learning about.</p>
                <p>For the next 12 weeks we will be stopping in chapters 1-9 of Acts learning about believers in the early church.</p>

                  <h4 class="h5">Who Wrote Acts?</h4>
                  <p>Before we begin let's discover who the author of Acts is. Let's turn to Acts 1:1. <span class="question-highlight">Does this verse name the author?</span></p>
                  <p>No, it names who the author was writing to.</p>
                  <p><span class="question-highlight">What is the person's name that the author was writing to?</span> (Theophilus-One who loves God)</p>
                  <p>In order to learn who the author is of this book let's turn to another passage in Scripture that is addressed to Theophilus. (Luke 1:1-4)</p>
                  <p><span class="question-highlight">Do you have a better idea now who the author of Acts is?</span> (Luke) Luke tells us why he wrote the Book of Luke in verse 4. Acts is a sequel to the Book of Luke teaching us the events that took place after Jesus returned to heaven.</p>
                  <p><span class="question-highlight">Does anyone know what kind of job Luke had?</span> (Allow students to answer.) Luke was a doctor. It's very important to back up statements we make about people from the Bible.</p>
                  <p><span class="question-highlight">Does anyone know where we would find that Luke is a doctor?</span> (Colossians 4:14)</p>

                <p><span class="question-highlight">Does anyone want to guess what language Luke wrote?</span></p>
                <p>Luke wrote in Greek. The Greek title for the Book of Acts (Praxeis Apostolon) when translated into English means <span class="scripture-link">The Acts of the Apostles</span>.</p>
                <p>This sequel that Luke has written will show us <span class="key-term">the works or deeds</span> that <span class="key-term">the <b>Apostles</b></span> did as they obeyed Jesus and went into the world sharing the Good News after He returned to Heaven.</p>
                <p>The Apostles are 12 men chosen by Jesus to take the Gospel to all nations. Each week as we read and learn from the Book of Acts, Luke will be the one who shares what he has seen and heard. A person who shares what they have seen is called a <span class="key-term">witness</span>. That word brings us to our memory verse for this morning. This verse is also the key verse for the entire book of Acts.</p>
                <p><span class="scripture-link">Acts 1:8</span>: "But you will receive <span class="key-term">power</span> when the <span class="key-term">Holy Spirit</span> comes on you; and you will be My <span class="key-term">witnesses</span> in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."</p>

                <p><span class="key-term">Power</span>: What does the word power mean? The Ability to do or act; capability of doing or accomplishing something; The possession of control or command over others; authority; ascendancy (Dictionary.com) Some verses that talk about power in the chapters we will be studying the next 12 weeks are: (Have students with the verses read them as you call them out. <span class="scripture-link">Acts 3:12</span>, <span class="scripture-link">Acts 4:33</span>, <span class="scripture-link">Acts 6:8</span> and <span class="scripture-link">Acts 9:22</span>.)</p>

                <p><span class="key-term">Holy Spirit</span>: The Holy Spirit is the 3<sup>rd</sup> person of the Trinity. The Trinity is made up of God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. The Father, Son and the Holy Spirit are equally God with different jobs. After Jesus went back to Heaven the Holy Spirit came and empowered the believers to do the work that Jesus told them to do. (<span class="scripture-link">Acts 2:38</span>; <span class="scripture-link">4:31</span>; <span class="scripture-link">5:32</span>; <span class="scripture-link">6:5</span>; <span class="scripture-link">9:31</span>)</p>
