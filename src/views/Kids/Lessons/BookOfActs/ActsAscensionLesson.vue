                <p>
                  Let's turn in our Bibles to Acts 1. Review with the class what they remember from
                  last week's overview of Acts 1-9.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Before we get into Acts chapter one, I would like for you to think about if there
                  has been a time when you felt abandoned and all alone? Maybe you have been in a
                  store with your family and you were distracted by something you were looking at
                  and when you looked around your family was gone.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <span class="highlight-text">At that moment how did you feel?</span> When a person
                  is left all alone, he/she may feel abandoned or deserted. For the few minutes you
                  were deserted by your family members you may have felt very frightened.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As soon as you were reunited with your family you were so relieved and comforted
                  to not have been truly abandoned. Jesus' disciples spent three years following
                  Him. They heard Him teach about God's Kingdom and witnessed Him perform many
                  miracles.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When they saw the Son of God nailed to a cross and die, they may have experienced
                  feelings of abandonment. They believed Jesus was God's Promised Messiah and now He
                  was dead and His body had been placed in a sealed tomb.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Feelings are not always the truth of what is really happening in a situation. If
                  the disciples had felt abandoned when Jesus died it was not the truth. Jesus told
                  them very clearly before He was nailed to the cross that He was going to suffer
                  and would rise again. Matthew 26:32 "But after I have risen, I will go ahead of
                  you into Galilee." (Matthew 16:21, Matthew 17:12, Mark 8:31, Luke 9:22)
                </p>

                <p>
                  Even though the disciples had been told by Jesus what to expect they were most
                  likely frightened and overwhelmed when the things that Jesus said would happen
                  were taking place. It would not have been easy to watch the innocent Son of God be
                  treated like a criminal and be nailed to a Roman Cross. It was very traumatic and
                  unsettling for Jesus' disciples.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Sometimes feelings of fear, sadness, or loneliness can cloud our hearts to the
                  truth that Jesus has spoken to us from His Word. The Bible is full of God's
                  instructions for His people to follow until He returns or calls them home. When we
                  have feelings that seem to overwhelm us, we need to find out the truth from
                  reading God's Word.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Three days after Jesus was buried in a sealed tomb God raised Him from the dead!
                  He did exactly what He told the disciples He would do.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To prove that Jesus was really alive and not a figment of the disciples'
                  imaginations, Jesus stayed on the earth for 40 days after His resurrection.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Let's look at Acts 1:3. Luke tells us that over those 40 days Jesus gave many
                  convincing proofs of His resurrection.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This morning as you arrived our activity was to make a mural that records the
                  different times that Jesus appeared to people in His resurrected body. (Allow
                  students to share the different times that Scripture tells of Jesus appearing to
                  someone or a group of people after He rose from the dead.)
                </p>

                <p>
                  It must have been so comforting to the once very frightened and discouraged
                  apostles to have Jesus with them again.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Luke tells us what Jesus did during the period of forty days. Let's look at the
                  last part of verse 3 and see what He did with the apostles. (He spoke about the
                  Kingdom of God.)
                </p>

                <p>
                  Jesus gave His apostles a very important instruction. Read Acts 1:4-5. Jesus knew
                  what God's plans were and He was preparing them for when He returned to heaven.
                  The apostles didn't fully understand what was about to happen. Even though they
                  didn't understand they needed to follow the instructions Jesus gave them.
                </p>

                <p>
                  God's plan was for Jesus to return to heaven. Jesus had chosen His apostles to be
                  messengers for Him after He left. What message did Jesus want His apostles to tell
                  others? Matthew 28:19-20.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Although Jesus was returning to heaven, He was not abandoning His apostles.
                  <span class="highlight-text">God never leaves or abandons His children.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                  Let's look at Acts 1:8. If you were here last week this was our memory verse. This
                  verse helps the Apostles to know that they would not be abandoned and left alone.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <span class="highlight-text"
                    >Jesus told them that God was going to send the Holy Spirit to give them His
                    power to take the message to all people.</span
                  >
                  This message could not be taken to the people without God's power. It was
                  important for the Apostles to obey Jesus' instructions and wait in Jerusalem for
                  the Holy Spirit.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When Jesus finished instructing the apostles, His feet lifted off the ground and
                  He began to ascend or go up into the sky. As He went up into the sky a cloud hid
                  Him from the apostles' sight. Let's imagine being there on that day. Do you think
                  the apostles strained to see Jesus and try to get just one last glimpse of Him?
                </p>

                <p>Let's read Acts 1:10-11. Who do you think these two men were? (Angels)</p>

                <p>
                  As we read this passage, we can see God's faithfulness to send these two men to
                  give this message. I wonder how long they would have stood there staring up into
                  the sky if they had not received this message from the 2 men.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The apostles had a job to do for the Lord Jesus. They had work to do but first
                  they needed to follow Jesus' instructions. He told them to stay in Jerusalem and
                  wait for the Holy Spirit.
                </p>

                <p>
                  They obeyed His instructions and went to Jerusalem. They went into a room where
                  they were staying. Let's find out who was in this upper room. Read Acts 1:13-14.
                </p>

                <p>
                  While they were waiting for the Holy Spirit what does verse 14 tell us these
                  people did? (They joined together constantly in prayer.)
                </p>

                <p>
                  Instead of allowing the fear of abandonment overwhelm them Jesus' followers spent
                  time praying and waiting for Jesus to send His Holy Spirit. Peter also spoke to
                  the group that was gathered. Let's read Acts 1:15 and find out how many were
                  gathered together when Peter spoke. Peter told the believers that when Judas
                  betrayed Jesus, he did exactly what God's Word said he would. Peter said that they
                  needed to select another apostle to replace Judas.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Peter told them what the requirements for an apostle needed to be. Look in Acts
                  1:21-22 to find out what they were. (Someone who had been with them the whole time
                  Jesus ministered on the earth until the time He ascended. He needed to be someone
                  who witnessed Jesus' resurrection.)
                </p>

                <p>
                  Two men selected based on the requirements were Justus and Matthias. The apostles
                  prayed and asked God which one He had chosen to replace Judas. The man chosen to
                  replace Judas was Matthias.
                </p>

                <p>
                  It would have been easy for the apostles to sit around feeling sad that Jesus had
                  returned to heaven. Instead, they chose to obey Jesus' instructions and wait in
                  Jerusalem for the Holy Spirit. They didn't just waste time as they waited, they
                  spent their time praying and waiting.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The apostles would miss having Jesus Walk with them and being able to see His
                  face. Very soon God would be sending the Holy Spirit to them. The Holy Spirit will
                  always be with them and go wherever they go. The Holy Spirit would give them power
                  to do the important job of sharing the Good News with other people.
                </p>

                <p>
                  After reading about the early days before Jesus returned to heaven we can be
                  encouraged that Jesus has not left us alone. He has not abandoned us. If we
                  believe that He died on the cross for our sins and was raised to life on the third
                  day, the moment we believed His Holy Spirit came to live inside our hearts.
                  <span class="highlight-text"
                    >We will never be alone and wherever we go, Jesus goes with us.</span
                  >
                  If we ever feel sad, alone or confused we have the entire Book of the Bible to
                  instruct us how to live our lives while we wait for Jesus to return or until He
                  takes us to be with Him in heaven.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Next week our lesson will be about when God sends His Holy Spirit on the day of
                  Pentecost. We hope you will not miss it!
