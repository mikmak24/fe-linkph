                  thankful that God has given you power in your legs to hop today? It would be
                  difficult to play this game if you couldn't stand or walk."

                  grandmother's eyes are not hurting her anymore. (Use this opportunity to say that
                  God is powerful and He has answered our prayers.) In our prayer time together
                  let's make sure to thank Him for healing your grandmother's eyes."

                <p>
                  "Good Morning boys and girls you may be wondering why I am so filled with joy and
                  excitement this morning? Let me tell you about my day!"
                </p>

                <p>
                  This morning a group of my family and friends gathered as they usually do and
                  carried me to the temple gate called Beautiful. I can see that you are wondering
                  why they would be carrying me when I came in here jumping and leaping around. You
                  see, this morning I had to be carried to the gate called Beautiful because when I
                  was born, I was crippled.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I couldn't walk or do anything for myself. As I got older and old enough to take
                  care of myself the only way I could make money was to sit at the temple gate and
                  beg people who came to worship. As the people walked by (hold out your silver cup)
                  I would say, 'Do you have any coins to spare?' Some people would drop a coin or
                  two in my cup and some would just pass on by.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Today was very much like every other day until right before 3 p.m. As I lay on my
                  mat holding out my cup as worshippers entered the temple courts for the time of
                  prayer, two men were passing me and were about to enter into the temple courts. I
                  called out, 'do you have some coins to spare?' The man looked straight into my
                  eyes. Not many people do that.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To many people I am sure beggars are annoying. To have someone look into my eyes
                  meant that most likely they were going to give me something. As this man looked at
                  me, he said, "Look at us." He had my attention; I was hoping for a nice offering
                  from him.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Imagine my surprise when he said, "Silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I
                  give to you. In the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk." The man who spoke
                  these words to me was Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ. I wanted money so I could
                  survive but he was offering me something so much greater than money.
                </p>

                <p>
                  He was offering me a new life! He was saying if I believed in Jesus I could walk.
                  No one has that kind of power except for God Himself. Peter reached his right hand
                  out to me and I took it. As he raised me up, I immediately felt strength in my
                  feet and ankles.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I had never stood up in my entire life. As I felt strength in my ankles and feet,
                  I took a step. Then I took another. I was so excited that I couldn't just walk I
                  began to jump and leap around! I followed Peter and his friend John into the
                  temple courts. I couldn't keep silent! As I leap around, I shouted "Praise God!
                  Praise God! Jesus has healed me! Thank you, Jesus! Thank you!"
                </p>

                <p>
                  Since it was about time for the people to gather to pray it was a bit out of the
                  ordinary for someone to be shouting and jumping around. People began to gather
                  around and as they looked at me, they were amazed. I stood there holding on to
                  Peter and John.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Word got out quickly that the man who was crippled was now jumping and leaping
                  around in the temple courts. Crowds of people came running into the area called
                  Solomon's Colonnade to see if it was true. As the crowds gathered around seeing me
                  standing on my feet Peter began to preach to the crowds.
                </p>

                <p>
                  He asked them, "Why does this surprise you? You are staring at us like we have
                  some way of healing this man. You know that God alone has power to heal a man. God
                  sent His Son Jesus into this world. You had Him handed over to be killed. You
                  acted like you didn't know Him by begging Pilate to release a murderer named
                  Barabbas instead of Jesus who was righteous. You killed the Author of Life but God
                  raised Him from the dead. We have witnessed His resurrection.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This man you see standing here was once crippled from birth. He believed that
                  Jesus could heal Him and through faith in Jesus he had been completely healed."
                </p>

                <p>
                  Peter told the people in the crowd that they could have their sins forgiven by
                  repenting and turning to God. Jesus would forgive them of their sins and they
                  could have everlasting life.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Boys and girls, I am so thankful for what Jesus did for me! I was physically
                  crippled for more than forty years (Acts 4:22). I couldn't get up and move around
                  on my own. When I put my faith in Jesus His power healed me.
                </p>

                <p>
                  There was a part of me that no one could see besides God that was paralyzed or
                  dead too. Because I was a sinner, I was unable to live a life that pleased God. My
                  sin separated me from a relationship with Him. When I believed in Jesus, He healed
                  me spiritually so now I have new life in my heart! Jesus' power saved me from my
                  sins and now I can have a relationship with God and live with Him forever.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Boys and girls, it is time for me to go but I want to encourage you that if you
                  have never believed in Jesus' today is the day you can be saved. Jesus' power that
                  healed me can heal you too. Talk to your teacher and she will share with you how
                  you can put your faith in Him."
                </p>

                    End by leaving the room or put the props away and say, "Did you enjoy our
                    visitor today? God's Word is full of exciting stories of His Power. As you
                    listened to the crippled man that was healed, we can only imagine what he
                    actually said. What we know for certain is written in Acts 3. Drama is a fun way
                    to try to see and feel what the person from the Bible may have experienced."

                  When you believe in Jesus, He has power to help you with whatever you need. That's
                  why when we pray, we end our prayers by saying "In Jesus' Name we pray. It is
                  because we believe that Jesus has power to hear and answer our prayers.
