                  As students arrive have them mark their date of birth on a calendar. The calendar
                  will be used during the lesson to talk about the Second Birth. This calendar can
                  be kept up during the year for students who are born again and would like to write
                  the date of their second birth on the calendar. You can let them place a small
                  sticker by their name if they want.

                  verse. After the verse is put together have the students stand in a circle and try
                  to bat their balloons in the air and keep them in the air as they recite the verse

                  We use a calendar to remind us of important events. Earlier we used this calendar
                  to mark each of our birthdays. The day each of us was born is a very important
                  day. God created us in our mother's womb and made each of us for a purpose. (Psalm
                  139:13-16) Birthdays celebrate the day God brought us into this world.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In our story today we are going to hear about another birthday. Let's turn in our
                  Bibles to Acts 2:22-24.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Last week we ended our story with Peter filled with the Holy Spirit speaking to
                  the crowd of Jewish people who were confused about hearing the wonderful works of
                  God being declared in their own language.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Today Peter is still speaking to the crowd and we are going to hear what else he
                  told the people on the Day of Pentecost.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit as he spoke these words to the crowd. He
                  shared the Good News that Jesus died on the cross and that God raised Him from the
                  dead.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The people in the audience were Jewish people. They had a great love for King
                  David written about in the Old Testament. As Peter preached to this crowd he
                  explained to them that the things that David spoke about many years ago were
                  pointing to the time when the Lord Jesus would be raised from the dead.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The next words that Peter spoke to the crowd would not have been easy to say on
                  his own. Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit and was able to tell the crowd that
                  they crucified Jesus the Savior God sent.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As the Holy Spirit convicted the audience of their sin, they wanted to know what
                  they needed to do next. Peter told them that they needed to repent and turn away
                  from their sin and turn to Jesus who died for their sins. By believing in Jesus
                  their sins would be forgiven.
                </p>

                <p>
                  After Peter explained what the people needed to do many of them believed in the
                  Lord Jesus and were saved. About 3,000 people had a new date to add to their
                  calendars - their second birthday. They were born again because even though they
                  were living they were dead in their sins.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Not only was this a day of celebrating being born again, it was also the day that
                  the very first church was born. A church is not a building but it is made up of
                  people that believe in the Lord Jesus.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The new believers gathered together regularly to hear the apostles teach about
                  Jesus. They fellowshipped, celebrated the Lord's Supper and prayed together. As
                  the believers lived a life filled with the Holy Spirit God continued to save
                  people on a daily basis causing the church to continue to grow.
                </p>
