                  Write the verse on the board. Have a strip of construction paper with fear on one
                  side and courage on the other (Explain that fear is another word for timidity). On
                  another piece have power on one side and weakness on the other. Love and hate, and
                  faithfulness/unfaithfulness (another way to describe self-discipline).

                <p>
                  After saying the verse together erase the words timidity, power, love and
                  self-discipline. You could use symbols on the strips of paper that represent
                  fear/courage etc. Have the students choose a word strip and let them decide which
                  word belongs in the spots that have been erased. For fun put all the opposites of
                  the correct words in the spaces and read it together.

                <p>
                  Encourage the students that whenever we feel the opposites we can know that it is
                  not the Holy Spirit that is causing us to feel that way. Memorizing this verse
                  helps us to trust God to give us His courage, power, love and faithfulness.

                  Have the students perform the brief skit about the healing of the crippled man.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Let's open our Bibles to Acts 4. Chapter four is a continuation of the story we
                  learned about last week. The people are gathered around in awe at the miracle that
                  had taken place. Peter and John told the people that it was by faith in Jesus'
                  Name that this man was healed.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Whenever God is at work in the hearts of people God's enemy doesn't like it. Who
                  is God's enemy? (Satan/devil) We are about to see God's enemy at work in chapter
                  four. Let's read Acts 4:1-3. What do we know about the religious leaders? (They
                  did not believe that Jesus was the Son of God and they had Him crucified.)
                </p>

                <p>
                  In this group of leaders that are included in verse 1 are the Sadducees. An easy
                  way to remember who the Sadducees are is that they did not believe that people
                  could be resurrected from the dead.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Whenever God's Word is being taught there will be some kind of reaction. Let's
                  look to see what the religious' leaders' reaction to what they saw and heard. Have
                  volunteer read Acts 4:2. They were disturbed.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Why do you think they were disturbed? (Allow students to respond and remind them
                  'why do you think' questions are not right or wrong answersâ€¦they are what we
                  think.) One reason they might be disturbed is because they thought when they put
                  Jesus to death that would be the end of Him. Obviously, it was not and would not
                  be the end of the Lord Jesus!&lt;/p&gt;
                </p>

                <p>
                  God's enemy Satan would try to use these religious leaders to silence the Good
                  News that the Lord Jesus died on the cross, was buried and three days later was
                  raised from the dead. Satan knew that if people put their faith in the Name of
                  Jesus they would be saved and he doesn't want that.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Since it was evening time the religious leaders decided to put Peter and John in
                  jail until the next day. Then they would decide what to do to have these men stop
                  teaching in the Name of Jesus.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Another response to the teaching of God's Word is seen by the reaction of the
                  crowd. The crowd at the temple courts that day witnessed an amazing miracle and
                  they heard Peter preach in the power of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit gave
                  Peter the words to share the Good News that if the people would repent from their
                  sins and believe in Jesus they could be saved. Let's read verse four and see how
                  many people believed that day. (The number grew to five thousand.)
                </p>

                <p>
                  In order to get an idea of how many people believed let's look back at Acts 2:41.
                  3,000 were saved at Pentecost and Acts 4:4 implies that the number grew to 5,000.
                  2,000 were saved that day.) This crowds' reaction to the teaching of God's Word
                  was belief.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Peter and John were obeying Jesus' command to tell others the Good News about
                  Jesus and found themselves in jail for a night. Believers will face difficulties
                  for obeying Jesus but God's Holy Spirit lives inside our hearts and He will give
                  us the power and courage to be obedient even in difficult times. (John 15:20, 1
                  Peter 4:12-16, 2 Timothy 3:12)
                </p>

                <p>
                  The next day Peter and John are brought before the religious leaders. They asked
                  them questions. What question did they ask in Acts 4:7? ("By what power or what
                  name did you do this?")
                </p>

                <p>
                  When each of you came in today you made a name tag with your name and what your
                  name means. Names are important because they represent who you are. A name
                  identifies you. When your name is called you will become attentive.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When your name is spoken to others you know your character traits will come to
                  their mind. Names have always been important in the Bible. People in Jesus' day
                  believed names were powerful and took them very seriously. That's possibly why the
                  religious leaders asked Peter and John this question.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Peter could not have answered the religious leaders with courage or boldness
                  unless he was filled with the Holy Spirit. It wasn't long ago that he saw the Lord
                  Jesus crucified by the religious leaders who hated Him. Without the Holy Spirit
                  Peter would have been afraid for his very own life.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Let's read Peter's response in Acts 4:8-12. Many of you have memorized verse 12.
                  There is no other Name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved. What
                  Name is Peter referring to? (Jesus)
                </p>

                <p>
                  Why is the Name of Jesus so important and why is His Name the only way a person
                  can be saved? If we had time to look throughout the Bible we would see many
                  references to the Name of the LORD. While my name and your name might only have
                  one meaning, the Name of the LORD is filled with many. Just a few words that
                  represent what the Name of the LORD means are: Holy, Creator, Powerful, Most High,
                  Strong Tower, Eternal, Love, Salvation and Good.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When Jesus' Name is mentioned His many character traits come to mind. When I say
                  the Name Jesus to you does liar come to mind? Cheater? Disobedient to authority?
                  None of these character traits are part of who Jesus is. Jesus is God and all the
                  character traits of God are found in Him.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As the Son of God Jesus alone can save a man, woman, boy or girl from sin. There
                  is power in the Name of Jesus. The crippled man was healed by faith in the Name of
                  Jesus. That is One Powerful Name!
                </p>

                <p>
                  While Peter was speaking to the religious leaders, they saw the courage that Peter
                  and John had. They knew these men were just ordinary men. Because Peter and John
                  had the power of the Holy Spirit living inside of them it was hard for others not
                  to notice something was different about them. They were astonished and they took
                  note that Peter and John had been with Jesus.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Do others see that about you and me? Can people see that we have courage that only
                  the Holy Spirit can give us and that it is very obvious that we have spent time
                  with Jesus? Do people think of us as more different than others? If we are
                  believers' people should be able to see that we are different because we follow
                  Jesus. They should see Jesus' character traits in us.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The religious leaders didn't like what they heard. They went off by themselves
                  without Peter and John to figure out what they should do. They had to be careful
                  how they went about doing this. They didn't want to upset the crowd because they
                  understood that everyone in Jerusalem knew that a miracle had taken place and that
                  couldn't be denied. They wanted to put a stop to people spreading the Good News
                  about Jesus to anyone else.
                </p>

                <p>
                  They brought Peter and John back in before them. This is what they came up with:
                  "We command you not to speak or teach at all in the Name of Jesus."
                </p>

                <p>
                  Let's read what Peter and John said in Acts 4:19-20. Because the Holy Spirit lived
                  inside of them Peter and John knew that they could not obey the religious leaders'
                  command because they would be disobeying Jesus' command to go into the world and
                  make disciples.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The religious leaders threatened Peter and John a bit more and then released them.
                  While God's enemy is at work through the religious leaders trying to stop Peter
                  and John from sharing the Good News let's look at what the people what the people
                  are doing that witnessed the miracle. Read Acts 4:21-22.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Something very important to take note of in these verses: The Holy Spirit
                  empowered Peter and John and the results caused the people to praise God not Peter
                  and John.
                </p>

                <p>
                  It was God who had shown His power through Peter and John. It would have been
                  terribly wrong for the crowd to praise Peter and John for the healing of the
                  crippled man. Followers of Jesus should always give God the credit for the
                  miracles He performs.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When Peter and John left, they went back to the place where the believers met and
                  shared with them what had happened with the religious leaders. Do you think when
                  the believers heard what happened to Peter and John, they whined and complained
                  about how terrible they were treated and how unfair it was that they had to spend
                  the night in jail?
                </p>

                <p>
                  Without the Power of the Holy Spirit inside of them they might have done that.
                  Believers act differently when the Holy Spirit controls them. Let's read what they
                  did do in Acts 4:24. They went to God in prayer and praised Him.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If you had spent the night in jail for sharing the Good News what do you think
                  your prayer request might be? We might pray for protection from God's enemies.
                </p>

                <p>
                  There's nothing wrong with that prayer it is just amazing that we don't see that
                  in the hearts of these believers in this passage. The Holy Spirit has filled them
                  with power and their request was to be able to speak God's Word with boldness and
                  that He would continue to heal others in the Name of Jesus.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The believers wanted to be obedient to what Jesus told them to do and they would
                  need courage to continue to do so. God heard the believers' prayer and something
                  amazing happened. Read Acts 4:31. There was an earthquake and the Holy Spirit gave
                  them the power to speak God's Word with power. This is an amazing story of how the
                  Holy Spirit gave believers the courage to share the Good News.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Today if you have believed in the Name of Jesus, you have the same Holy Spirit
                  living inside you so you can have courage to follow Jesus and share the Good News
                  with others. Next week we will continue to take our journey through the Book of
                  Acts. As we go through the week let's spend time each day in God's Word and
                  praying that He will give us the courage to be obedient to what He wants us to do
                  each day. His Holy Spirit will give us power to live a life that pleases God and
                  points others to Jesus.

                  You can combine the review questions with the Scripture phrase activity. Put the
                  phrases in random order on a table or the floor and when the student gets the
                  answer correct, he/she can choose the phrase that they believe comes first. Allow
                  them to put them in the order they think. After the review questions have been
                  answered look at the ordering together and if necessary, look at the passage
                  together if there are any discrepancies.
