                    <p>We Christians realize that the most important parts of our lives are those that make an impact for eternity. The study of God and his relations to, purposes for, and work within the created universe- Matters! Welcome to our Link Group where we focus on biblical small groups grounded in the teachings of the bible. Our goal is to ground biblical believers and to develop disciples that make disciplines!</p>
                    <p>To begin our study in Bible doctrine, we ought to begin with God. We are constantly challenged by atheists, skeptics and hecklers to prove that there is a God.</p>
                    <p>It is difficult for natural man to believe in something that he cannot see, touch or feel, <strong>1 Corinthians 2:14</strong>.</p>
                    <p>The problem for the Christian is solved in the first verse of the Bible, "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth," <strong>Genesis 1:1</strong>.</p>
                    <p>The Bible is not a textbook that attempts to prove the existence of God — the Bible opens with a positive fact that God does exist. It did not occur to any other writer of the Bible to prove this fact.</p>
                    <p>The Bible plainly states that it is the fool who denies the existence of God. <strong>Psalm 14:1</strong> "The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God."</p>
                    <p>Anyone with any intelligence would acknowledge the evident fact of a living God.</p>
                    <p>The greatest proof apart from Scripture of the existence of God is our daily fellowship with Him in prayer. I know that there is a God because I talked to Him today and He heard and answered the prayer of my heart though it was only whispered silently.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-primary mb-3">I PROOF FROM SCRIPTURE</h4>
                    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Psalm 19:1</strong> "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows His handiwork." The beauty and glory of the heavens speak loudly saying, "God exists."</p>
                    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Romans 1:20</strong> goes farther and suggests that creation even teaches about the eternal power of the Godhead, "For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse."</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">The man who accepts Scripture will readily acknowledge the existence of God.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">In addition to the argument from Scripture, we may consider seven other powerful "proofs."</p>
                  </div>

                  <!-- II PROOF FROM CONSCIENCE -->
                  <div class="content-card mb-4">
                    <h4 class="text-primary mb-3">II PROOF FROM CONSCIENCE</h4>
                    <p class="mb-3">Man is born with a universal belief in a supreme Being; no tribe has yet been discovered that lacks this. They know that some Being creates and controls.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Romans 2:15</strong> "Who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and between themselves their thoughts accusing or else excusing them." The existence of God is written in the human conscience.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Acts 17:23</strong> "For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, To the Unknown God." Conscience told them that there was a God even though they did not know Him personally.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Some atheists may claim that their conscience does not tell them about God. It is doubtful if genuine atheists can be found, for at best they are men who have silenced their conscience by blatant unbelief.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Some men are so blind that they may deny the existence of the sun in the sky, but that does not alter the fact that the sun exists, rises and sets each day. None are so blind as those who refuse to see. The honest man will find that the inner still small voice says that God exists and is alive today.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Men deny the existence of God not because they cannot find Him, but because they are afraid to face the responsibility of being accountable to Him after death.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Atheism is one of the devil's tools to put men to sleep without accepting salvation. If there is no God then I am not responsible to anyone and I can live and die as I please.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">But in the quieter moments of reflection the conscience of every man whispers, "There is a God," and only fools deny it. To look up into the heavens and say that there is no God, simply because we cannot see Him, is as ridiculous as seeing a plane and saying that the plane is pilotless because we cannot see the pilot.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Few of us have ever seen our brains, yet we believe that we possess them because of a centralized control system in the body. Because we see creation, we believe in God.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-primary mb-3">III THE ARGUMENT FROM CAUSE (COSMOLOGICAL)</h4>
                    <p class="mb-3">The world is here. It must have come from somewhere. Somebody or something must have caused it to come into being at one time or another.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Here is a book. Someone must have written it. No printing press can of itself produce a book, be it ever so modern a press with the latest electrical gadgets.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Someone built this building. Someone created the trees. Someone operates the universe.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">If all the pieces of a watch were placed in a can and the can shaken gently for a million years the watch would not be "accidentally" put together and running.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">The only sensible answer to the problem of the existence of the world is the existence of an intelligent Being whom we call God.</p>
                  </div>

                    <h4 class="text-primary mb-3">IV THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN (TELEOLOGICAL)</h4>
                    <p class="mb-3">A watch not only exists but it has a designer. It was planned for a specific purpose.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">A watch was not designed for mosquitoes to live in. It was designed by a keen mind for the purpose of accurately telling the time.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">An examination of the world and the things large and small shows that each is designed by an intelligent mind for a specific purpose in life.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">The colors of a bird and means of defence of the animals are not accidents. They are the result of a plan of a superior planning mind of the originator.</p>

                  <!-- V THE MORAL ARGUMENT (ANTHROPOLOGICAL) -->
                  <div class="content-card mb-4">
                    <h4 class="text-primary mb-3">V THE MORAL ARGUMENT (ANTHROPOLOGICAL)</h4>
                    <p class="mb-3">Man has an intellectual and moral nature showing that the Creator must not be merely an inanimate force but a living, intelligent moral Being.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Genesis 1:26</strong> "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness."</p>
                    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Genesis 1:27</strong> God created man in the image and likeness of God, that is, patterned after Him.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Psalm 94:9</strong> "He that planted the ear, shall He not hear? He that formed the eye, shall He not see?" God has given to man ears, eyes, knowledge, intelligence, and willpower, for these are the things that He possesses.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Conscience teaches man right and wrong, good and bad; for the Creator is a moral Being that is holy, and loves righteousness but abhors evil.</p>
                  </div>

                  <!-- VI THE LIFE ARGUMENT -->
                  <div class="content-card mb-4">
                    <h4 class="text-primary mb-3">VI THE LIFE ARGUMENT</h4>
                    <p class="mb-3">Life comes from life and the original life must have come from a Being possessing eternal life, that is, life that existed before physical life was created.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Where can such life be found? It can only be found in God, who possesses eternal life: <strong>Psalm 36:9</strong> "For with Thee is the fountain (source) of life."</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">The apple tree gets its life from the parent tree, the lamb from the mother sheep. But where did they get life from? We go back to the original creation.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Jesus said in <strong>John 11:25</strong>, "I am ... life," — also in <strong>John 14:6</strong>, "I am... life," and in <strong>John 10:28</strong>, "And I give unto them eternal life."</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">All life proceeds from God. The theory of spontaneous generation has been proved false and completely unacceptable to authoritative science. Life must have a beginning. The only logical answer is that the beginning was with God.</p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="content-card mb-4">
                    <h4 class="text-primary mb-3">VII THE ARGUMENT FROM CONGRUITY</h4>
                    <p class="mb-3">The theory of atheism solves no problems but only multiplies unsolved mysteries.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">The acceptance of the existence of God as Creator of the world is like a magic key that fits all the facts of Scripture, revelation, knowledge and science.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">This irrefutable doctrine is held tenaciously by multitudes of souls who are willing both to live and die in the consolation of this assurance.</p>
