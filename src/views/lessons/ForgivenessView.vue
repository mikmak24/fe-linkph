The study of God and his relations to, purposes for, and work within the created universe- Matters! Welcome to our Link Group where we focus on biblical small groups grounded in the teachings of the bible. Our goal is to ground biblical believers and to develop disciples that make disciplines!</p>
                    <p>By virtue of the fall of man all men have become sinners. Sin is the one thing that will keep men out of heaven; heaven is a holy place and nothing evil shall ever enter there. The keynote to getting to heaven is forgiveness; if God forgives us our sins then no one will be able to prevent us from entering heaven.</p>
                    <p>To sinful man forgiveness become the most important problem in his life. In the Old Testament there are three words for forgiveness: One means "to cover"; another means "to lift away"; and the third means "to send away".</p>
                    <p>"In the New Testament forgiveness is the separation of the sinner from his sins through the sacrifice of Christ and upon the ground of pure grace" – R. Lee I.</p>

                    <p class="mb-3">God alone Since the sinner has broken the law of God, only God can forgive him that sin. If you steal my hammer I can forgive you for that but if you break one of the laws of the Philippines I cannot forgive you for that. When you break the law of God no man upon earth can forgive; only God can forgive you.</p>
                    <ul class="scripture-list">
                      <li><strong>Lk. 7:49</strong>, …began to say within themselves, who is this that forgiveth sins also?</li>
                      <li><strong>Mk. 2:7</strong>, Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-3">The Jews in both cases were correct for only God can forgive sin. Never go to a human being for forgiveness when you've broken God's law; go directly to God. Never go to a human mediator for forgiveness; go directly to the One sinned against. <strong>1 John 1:9</strong>, If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive … He, the Lord God, the holy One, the giver of the law, is willing to forgive sinners. Because Jesus is both God and the Son of God, He has been appointed to forgive sin. <strong>Acts 5:31</strong>, Him hath God exalted with His right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.</p>

                    <p class="mb-3">Jesus Christ <strong>Acts 13:38</strong>, Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man (Jesus Christ) is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins. This is the wonderful message of salvation to sin-burdened souls.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">In <strong>Luke 7:48</strong>, the Savior personally forgave the woman, Thy sins are forgiven.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">In <strong>Mark 2:9</strong>, Jesus personally forgave the palsied man, Thy sins be forgiven thee. Jesus is not here bodily today but He is here invisibly ready to forgive each one of us. We can close our eyes right now and tell Him all about our sins and He will forgive.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Forgiveness cannot be found in a Church, sacrament or ordinance but alone in Christ.</p>

                      <p><strong>Eph. 1:7</strong>, In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins… By Blood is meant the propitiatory crosswork of Christ. On the cross he shed His blood as a ransom and complete payment for our eternal redemption.</p>
                      <p>God has decreed that, The soul that sinneth, it shall die, <strong>Ezek. 18:4</strong>. Sin brought death, and because man sinned, as a consequence he must die. <strong>Gen. 2:17</strong>, In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. God has always required blood, symbolical of death as payment for sin. To cover the nakedness of Adam and Eve, blood was shed to get the coats of skin, <strong>Gen. 3:21</strong>.</p>
                      <p>Abel's offering was accepted because it contained blood, and Cain's offering was rejected because it did not have blood, <strong>Gen. 4:3-5</strong>.</p>
                      <p><strong>Lev. 17:11</strong>, For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.</p>

                    <ul class="scripture-list">
                      <li><strong>Psa. 103:3</strong>, Who forgiveth ALL thine iniquities…</li>
                      <li><strong>Psa. 32:1-2</strong>, Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity… The Lord forgives the transgression, sin, iniquity – everything, ALL forgiven.</li>
                      <li><strong>Col. 2:13</strong>, …having forgiven you all trespasses.</li>
                      <li><strong>Matt. 12:31</strong>, Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men… This is a most important point.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-3">If one sin remained unforgiven that individual could not go to heaven, but would be forced to spend eternity in hell. <strong>Rev. 21:27</strong>, And there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth… One sin can contaminate you and heaven forever; one sin brought death on all men.</p>
