                    <p>The study of God has been the ambition of philosophers, etc., for many millenniums. Some sit and meditate and try to think into the realm of the eternal Being.</p>
                    <p>The only true knowledge about God can be gained from the Bible. John 1:18, "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him." I John 4:12, "No man hath seen God at any time."</p>
                    <p>Exodus 33:20 (God speaking to Moses), "And He said, Thou canst not see My face: for there shall no man see Me, and live." Exodus 33:23, "And I will take away Mine hand, and thou shalt see My back parts: but My face shall not be seen." Moses talked to God and saw part of Him but did not see the Lord's face. Jesus who is God's Son came from heaven to reveal the Father God to us.</p>
                    <p>Jesus speaking to Philip, John 14:7-11, says that Jesus is the revelation of God. Pagan wisdom says, "Man, know thyself," but Jesus says, "Man, learn of the Father." John 17:3 tells us that to know God and Christ His Son is to have eternal life, "And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent."</p>
