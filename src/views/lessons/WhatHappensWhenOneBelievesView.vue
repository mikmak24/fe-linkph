                    <p>We Christians realize that the most important parts of our lives are those that make an impact for eternity. The study of God and his relations to, purposes for, and work within the created universe- Matters! Welcome to our Link Group where we focus on biblical small groups grounded in the teachings of the bible. Our goal is to ground biblical believers and to develop disciples that make disciplines!</p>
                    <p><strong>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ONE BELIEVES ON THE LORD</strong> is an important query one should ask. Maybe all we know is that we are called Christians but not really understanding what God had deposited in us when we accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as our Saviour.</p>
                    <p>Just like a vehicle, the motor running, gears engaging and then the moment that the driver releases the clutch many, many things happen but perhaps all the driver knows is that the car is in motion. Actually, perhaps a hundred things have happened which he will gradually learn.</p>
