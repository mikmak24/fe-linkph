                    <p>Last week we were talking about life. We tried to define it and understand it. We decided that life was a moment of time to prepare for eternity. Life is saddened by the fact that it must end sooner or later in death unless Jesus returns to call home His church. We found it difficult to define life. Can we define death? Death is the departure of life – the cessation of life. Death is the change from the animate to the inanimate. Death is when the heart stops, when the breath ceases, when the body is a stiff corpse.</p>

                    <p>Death is the direct result of sin. In case of physical death the doctor may write any one of many things on the death certificate, but the real answer is SIN.</p>
                    <p>Sin is the basic cause and disease the immediate agency that God used to execute the sentence that was pronounced on mankind in the Garden of Eden. Ezek. 18:20, The soul, that sinned, it shall die. Rom. 6:23, For the wages of sin is death. Heb. 9:27, And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment.</p>

                      <li><strong>As going to a place of no return.</strong> Job 16:22, When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return. See also Luke 16:31.</li>
                      <li><strong>As going down into silence.</strong> Psa. 115:17, The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.</li>
                      <li><strong>As yielding up the ghost.</strong> Acts 5:10, "Sapphira", and in Luke 23:46, of the Savior.</li>

                    <p>Modern science and doctors can do a great deal to prolong life. The life span is lengthening, but that is merely postponing the day of death. We are "Appointed to die", Heb. 9:27. We are born with an appointment to meet death. We must keep that appointment. The one true remedy is found in the Lord Jesus Christ. Spiritual death is cured by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ. John 5:24, Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. When we believe on Christ, the Holy Spirit works the miracle of regeneration in our lives, transforming us into children of God. John 1:12. Physical death can be avoided by the rapture of the church. But Christ has promised to walk with us (Christians) through the experience of death. Psa. 23:4, Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me… (Those that can truthfully say, "The Lord is MY Shepherd," can also claim this promise.)</p>

                    <p>Why did Jesus die on the cross? Was it an accident? Certainly not. God's Word said that someone must die for sin. Jesus volunteered to be the One to die. He died the death that YOU AND I ought to have died. Heb. 2:9, …that He by the grace of God should taste death for every man. Jesus tasted the bitter dregs of death for you. Oh, reject Him no longer. Jesus died on the cross as a sacrifice for you and me. Eph. 5:2, …and hath given Himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God. The death of the Savior was necessary for the redemption of mankind. Luke 24:46, …Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day. What is the Gospel? 1 Cor. 15:1-4 defines it as that Christ suffered for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried and that He rose the third day. That is, the Gospel includes death, the death of the Savior for sin.</p>
