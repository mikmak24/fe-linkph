                    <p>We Christians realize that the most important parts of our lives are those that make an impact for eternity. The study of God and his relations to, purposes for, and work within the created universe- Matters! Welcome to our Link Group where we focus on biblical small groups grounded in the teachings of the bible. Our goal is to ground biblical believers and to develop disciples that make disciplines!</p>
                    <p>How shall we deal with predestination, election and human responsibility? We should not oppose them against each other, for the Bible does not oppose them against each other. Nor should we modify, or water down them, for this is not what the Bible does. What the Bible does is to assert these truths side by side in the strongest possible ways. C.H. Spurgeon was once asked if he could reconcile these truths. He said, "I wouldn't try, I never reconcile friends." This is the point we have to grasp. Predestination, Divine choice, and human responsibility are not enemies.</p>

                    <p class="mb-3">Let us begin by defining predestination. It contains the prefix "pre," which means "before." "Destination" is the place we are ultimately trying to reach. Another word that we can use in this context is destiny. Predestination, therefore, is the doctrine that "from all eternity, God somehow and in some way predetermines." Predestination means to choose beforehand.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">In this sense, God makes decisions in advance, which means He has perfect foreknowledge of what will happen in the future. "Election" means "to pick or to choose." Most Christians will agree on the above definition of predestination. Where they differ is how God makes His decision regarding our individual destinies.</p>
