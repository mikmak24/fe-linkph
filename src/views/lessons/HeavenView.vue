                    <ul class="scripture-list">
                      <li><strong>Gen. 1:1</strong> - "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." When or how long ago is a mystery hidden from man. Heaven will abide forever.</li>
                      <li><strong>2 Cor. 5:1</strong> - "…an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens." Heaven is a prepared place (Jn. 14:2), for a prepared people.</li>

                    <ul class="scripture-list">
                      <li>Heaven is the home of the Lord God. <strong>Matt. 6:9</strong> - "Our Father which art in heaven…"</li>
                      <li><strong>2 Cor. 12:2</strong> speaks of a man caught up to the third heaven. The first heaven is the area where birds fly. The second heaven is where sputniks go. The third heaven is the home or throne of the Lord God. Heaven is a building.</li>
                      <li><strong>2 Cor. 5:1</strong> - "For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens." Heaven is a building of God. It is not man-made.</li>
                      <li>Heaven is called a garner. <strong>Matt. 3:12</strong> - "…gather His wheat into the garner." This occurs at the division of the wheat (good doing to heaven) and the chaff being burned.</li>
                      <li>Heaven is called the kingdom of God and of Christ. <strong>Eph. 5:5</strong> - "…hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God."</li>
                      <li>Heaven is called the Father's House. <strong>John 14:2</strong> - "In My Father's house …"</li>
                      <li>Heaven is called a place of rest. <strong>Heb. 4:9</strong> - "There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God." Heaven is called paradise.</li>
                      <li><strong>2 Cor. 12:4</strong> - "And I knew such a man … caught up into paradise."</li>

                    <p>It is immeasurable.</p>
                    <ul class="scripture-list">
                      <li><strong>Jer. 31:37</strong> - "Thus saith the Lord; If heaven above can be measured …" <strong>Rev. 21:1</strong> - "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea." Some have erroneously considered the new Jerusalem of this chapter as heaven. The new Jerusalem is of equal length, width and height. That is, 12,000 furlongs.</li>
                      <li>It figured the cubical contents at being capable of holding 49,679,308,800,000,000,000 (49 ½ pentillion) people. But that does not allow space for trees and the river of life. From creation to 1928, 302 hexillion people born. (302,231,454,903, 657, 293,676, 543). From creation to the present is about 77 generations (42 before Christ and 35 after). If these were all alive they would cover the earth to a depth of 113,326 miles. There were enough people born between Christ and Columbus to fill the New Jerusalem.</li>
                      <li><strong>Rev. 21:2, 10</strong>. But heaven is for the limited few who are holy and pure and the mansions are definitely limited so it is very wise to book a mansion this very day.</li>

                      <li>Heaven is a place without death, tears, sorrow, crying or pain. <strong>Rev. 21:4</strong> - "…and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away."</li>
                      <li>Heaven is a place without night or darkness. <strong>Rev. 22:3-5</strong> - "…and there shall be no night there…neither light of the sun: for the Lord God giveth them light …"</li>
                      <li>Heaven is a place without hunger, thirst, excessive heat. <strong>Rev. 7:16</strong> - "They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat."</li>
