                    <p>The truth is that life is very difficult to define. Life is a trust, a loan from God for a short period of time.</p>

Acts 17:28, For in Him we live, and move, and have our beingâ€¦ Job 1:21, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD. Life is an intangible gift from God. We can neither see it, feel it, or bargain with it. Life is an unsubstantial flimsy thing. It is here today and gone tomorrow.</p>

                    <p>All life comes from God. 1 John 5:20, This is the 2 true God, and eternal life. Life is a characteristic, an attribute, the very nature of the Almighty God.</p>

Psa. 89:47, Remember how short my time is. Job 14:1, Man that is born of a woman is of few days. James 4:13-15, Life is like a vapour that quickly vanishes away. Life is limited to a set time.
